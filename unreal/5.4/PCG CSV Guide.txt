Place the HoudiniDataTable.uasset in your Unreal content folder with the correct unreal version.
There's a node called "Break CSV points" that Unreal will not recognize, all you have to do is recreate it and rewire it to the other nodes.

Note: If the "Break CSV points" does not exist in the Unreal Project, you can copy and paste the content of the above text file into the Houdini Import Data table graph and rewire the connections.
