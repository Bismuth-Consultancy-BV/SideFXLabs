When opening Houdini_DataTable.uasset for the first time, Unreal is unable to find the node called "Break CSV points", all you have to do is recreate it and rewire it to the other nodes.

Note: In case the "Break CSV points" does not exist in the search, you can copy and paste the content from  "Break CSV Points Copy and Paste.txt" text file into the Houdini Import Data table graph to recreate "Break CSV points" and rewire the connections.
