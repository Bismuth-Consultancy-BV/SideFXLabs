""" Transfer UVs between a source and target geometry. """

Transferring UVs is a surprisingly non-trivial task. It’s ok if you’re working with identical geometry, but any other circumstance it’s easy to get a tangled mess.

The UV transfer sop employs a variety of tricks under the hood (working per UV shell, carefully working with UV borders, measuring area), to give clean and resilient UV transfers.

The following gif shows a common use case; shapes that are similar (a high and low res pig), the low res mesh has no UVs and needs them transferred from the high-res. You can see a default attrib transfer fails, but the UV transfer sop works successfully.


@parameters
    UV Attribute:
        Determine which attribute represents UVs.
    Fuse Tolerance:
        Determines how aggressive to fuse UVs.
    Border Fuse Tolerance:
        Determines how aggressive to fuse UVs on the border points
