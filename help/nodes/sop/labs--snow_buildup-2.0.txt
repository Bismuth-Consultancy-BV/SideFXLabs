""" Creates geometry to an input mesh that mimics snow build up. """

This node generates snow buildup by extruding specified faces upwards. The selection of these faces are determined by facing-direction, thickness and curvature attributes of the input mesh.
Noise is added to the geometry, deforming the snow surface differently than the edges.

@parameters

    == Snow Scattering ==

    Keep Original:
        #id: keeporiginal
	When enabled, merges result with input mesh.

    Seed:
        #id: seed
	All generated values depend (pseudo)randomly on this value. This random seed is used for determining the entire noise distribution.
        
    Snow Direction:
        #id: dir
	Direction from which the snow is coming.
        
    Occlude Mesh:
        #id: occludemesh
	When activated, snow will only appear on the surface which is directly hit by snow.
        
    Coverage:
        #id: angle
	Deviation from the snow direction where snow might fall. If __Coverage__ parameter is too wide, __Occlude Mesh__ might become useless.
        
    Voxel Size:
        #id: resolution
	The desired voxel size of the new VDB points grid. The lower this value, the more detail the mesh will have.
        
    == Snow Surface ==

    Unit:
        #id: unit
	Choose whether parameter values are relative to the input mesh size or to the world.

    Base Height:
        #id: baseheight
	Height of the initial snowfall. 
        
    Noise Height:
        #id: snowheight
	The maximum amount of random height added to __Base Height__.
        
    Noise Frequency:
        #id: snowfrequency
        Frequency in which __Noise Height__ will randomize: the smaller the value, the larger the bump size.

    Minimum Patch Area:
        #id: minarea
	The minimum area allowed for snow patches. Patches with area smaller than this value will be removed.
        
    Smoothing Iterations:
        #id: smoothiterations
	Amount to smooth edges of of the snow surface. Higher values move the points farther from their original positions. 
        
    == Edge Detail ==

    Melt Border:
        #id: meltborder
	When enabled, lowers the border of the mesh to mimic melting.
        
    Melt Iterations:
        #id: meltiterations
        How melted the surface snow is. Higher values move the points farther down.

    Type:
        #id: typenoise
	Select between different noise types.       

        Simple:
	Keep snow edges as is.
            
        Stratification and Melted:
	Mimics bands of snow that melted.

	[Image:/images/snb_stratification_melted.png]
            
        Shoveled:
	Mimics bands of snow that was shoveled.

	[Image:/images/snb_shoveled.png]
            
        Stratification With Holes:
	Mimics bands of snow that melted with additional holes.

	[Image:/images/snb_stratification_holes.png]
            
        Melted with Holes:
	Mimics snow that has naturally melted.

	[Image:/images/snb_melted_holes.png]
	
            
    Intensity:
        #id: intensitynoise
	The intensity of the noise. Higher values move the points farther from their original positions. 
        
    Element Size:
        #id: scalenoise
	Uniform scale of elements in the noise. Lower value means more 'tiling'.
        
    Additional Blurring:
        #id: addbluriteration
	Amount to smooth edges. Higher values may result in a loss of details.
