""" Transfer uv's between a source and target geometry. """

Transferring uv’s is a surprisingly non-trivial task. It’s ok if you’re working with identical geometry, but any other circumstance it’s easy to get a tangled mess.

The uv transfer sop employs a variety of tricks under the hood (working per uv shell, carefully working with uv borders, measuring area), to give clean and resilient uv transfers.

The following gif shows a common use case; shapes that are similar (a high and low res pig), the low res mesh has no uv’s and needs them transferred from the high-res. You can see a default attrib transfer fails, but the uv transfer sop works successfully.


@parameters
