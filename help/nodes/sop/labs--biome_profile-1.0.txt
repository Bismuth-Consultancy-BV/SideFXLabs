= Labs Biome Profile (Beta) =

"""An interface to change underlying biome parameters and related settings of the Labs Biome system."""


The biome settings displayed are saved in an external JSON file, and this interface allows editing of the different biome properties. 

:note:
	The biome tools are in beta and are subject to change based off of feedback, testing, and future development. We encourage our users to let us know of any feedback or bugs they encounter while using these tools.


@parameters


	Biome Profile:
		#id: biomeprofile
		Path to the biome profile JSON containing biome data such as names, parameters, etc. This data is set through the [Labs Biome Profile|Node:sop/labs--biome_profile-1.0] node.

    Sync Profile Paths:
        #id: applysettingsnodes
	Sets the __Biome Profile__ path on all Biome nodes within this geometry context to the path specified here.

    Reload Profile:
        #id: loadsettings
	Reloads biome profile selected in __Biome Profile__. Reloading before saving any changes will revert parameters back to the saved settings.
        
    Save Profile:
        #id: savesettings
	Save biome settings to the JSON specified in __Biome Profile__. This will overwrite the current biome settings JSON. To create a new settings file, the JSON file path must be changed in __Biome Profile__ to a new file name with the .json extension.
        
    == Settings ==

    Biome:
        #id: biomename#
	Biome name to assign to this specified settings list.
        
    Average Temperature:
        #id: avgtemp#
	Average temperature of associated biome (in Celsius).
        
    Average Precipitation:
        #id: avgprecip#
	Average precipitation of associated biome per year (in millimeters).
