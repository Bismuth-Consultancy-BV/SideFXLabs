= Labs Biome Curve Label (Alpha) =

"""This node sets the necessary attributes on curves created in Houdini to use with _Labs Biome Region Assign SOP_."""

Instead of the biome interface handled through _Labs Biome Region Assign_ for all other region assignment methods, this node assigns the necessary attributes to curves as they are created. The first input is the corresponding curve, and the second input is the Previous _Biome Curve Label_ SOP in the chain. For curves that can share a biome assignment, it is possible to merge them together first before wiring into the first input.



@parameters

== ==

	Path to Biomes:
		#id: pathtobiomes
		Node path to the last _Labs Biome Define SOP_ in a chain of nodes or a _Biome Definitions File SOP_ set to create geometry from a biome definitions file. A list of biomes defined by this path will populate the __Biome__ ordered menu.

    == Curve Setup ==

    Biome Name:
        #id: biomename_curve
	The biome to assign this region. To adjust biome names, settings, or add/delete biomes, see [Labs Biome Define|Node:sop/labs--biome_define-1.0].
        
    Biome Hierarchy:
        #id: biomehierarchy
	The priority to assign to the associated curve(s). A higher number will give the biome priority when using __Resolve Overlaps by Hierarchy__ on the [Labs Biome Region Assign|Node:sop/labs--biome_region_assign-1.0] SOP.
        
    Create Next :
        #id: createnext
	Creates the _Biome Curve Setup_ node for the next curve region and connects the related wires.
