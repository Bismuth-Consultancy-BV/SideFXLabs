= Labs Terrain Analysis (Beta) =

"""This node analyzes a HeightField and generates cost and avoidance attributes."""

This node takes a HeightField as the main input, and analyzes it to generate cost and avoidance attributes. There is an option to split the terrain into tiles to multithread the process. There are also options to change the resolution of the terrain mesh conversion that is required for the analysis, as well as various input methods for the avoidance.


@parameters

    == Analysis ==

    === Multithreading ===

    Enable Multithreaded Process:
        #id: enablemultithreading
        Enables the multithreading process.

    Tiles per Axis:
        #id: tilesperaxis
        The number of rows of tiles the mesh is divided into.

    Resolution Mode:
        #id: resolutionmode
        The mode to set the resolution for the mesh conversion.

        Automatic:
        The resolution is derived from the HeightField.
            
        Specified:
        The resolution is set by the user.
        
    Resolution per Tile:
        #id: resolutionpertile
        The mesh resolution for each individual tile.
        
    === Output Attributes ===

    Slope Toggle:
        #id: slope
        Output the slope attribute.
        
    Slope:
        #id: slopeattributename
        The name of the slope attribute.
        
    Avoidance Toggle:
        #id: avoidance
        Output the avoidance attribute.
        
    Avoidance:
        #id: avoidanceattributename
        The name of the avoidance attribute.
        
    Avoidance from:
        #id: avoidancemenu
        The input of the avoidance attribute.

        HeightField Mask:
        The avoidance is derived from the mask of the input HeightField.
            
        Second Input:
        The avoidance is derived from the second input.
            
        Operator Path:
        The avoidance is derived from an operator.
            
    HeightField Mask:
        #id: maskname
        The name of the HeightField's mask.

    Avoidance Path:
        #id: avoidancepath
        The path of the operator to derive the avoidance from.

        The size ratio of the padded tile to the base tile.
        
    == Visualization ==

    Enable Visualization:
        #id: enablevisualization
        Visualizes the mesh tiles or a generated attribute as color.
        
    Visualize:

        Attribute:
        Visualizes the generated attribute as color.
            
    === Attribute ===

    Attribute:
        #id: visualizeattribute
        The name of the attribute to visualize.
        
    Color Ramp:
        #id: attrcolorramp
        The color ramp that is used for the visualization.
