"""This node generates different chaotic maps."""

This node assigns point locations based on different chaotic maps and computes the point cloud density. It can also generate a color and pscale attribute based on the point density.


@parameters

    == Type ==

    Chaotic Map:
        #id: type
	Selects between different maps.
        
                        
    == Number of Points ==

    Total Count:
        #id: totalcount
	Sets the total number of points being generated.
        
    == Constants ==

    Constants Presets:
        #id: constantspresets
	Sets preset initial conditions to generate different results.
        
                       
    Manually Override Constants (Unpredictable Behavior):
        #id: overrideconstants
	Playing with the constants will yield erratic behaviour. When manually overriding constants, set a low number of generated points and turn off "Compute Point Cloud Density" to iterate faster.
        
        
    == Attributes ==

    === Point Density ===

    Compute Point Cloud Density:
        #id: computedensity
	The density is equal to the number of points found in the defined radius divided by the maximum number of search points.
        
    Density Attribute:
        #id: densityattribute
	The name of the density attribute. Defaults to "density".
        
    Search Distance:
        #id: searchdistance
	The radius used by each point to find the closest relative points. Increasing the search distance will impact performance.        

    Maximum Search Points:
        #id: maxpts
	The maximum number of points to look for. Increasing this parameter will impact performance.
        
    === Point Color ===

    Add Color by Density:
        #id: addcolorbydensity
	Generates a Cd attribute based on the computed density attribute.
        
    Ramp Color:
        #id: rampcolor
	Ramp drives the Cd attribute.
        
    === Point Radius ===

    Add Pscale by Density:
        #id: addpscalebydensity
	Generates a pscale attribute based on the computed density attribute.
        
    Minimum Pscale:
        #id: minimumpscale
	The minimum value to map pscale to.
        
    Maximum Pscale:
        #id: maximumpscale
	The maximum value to map pscale to.
        
    Display as Spheres:
        #id: displayasspheres
	Displays points as gl_spheres in the viewport.
