= Labs Biome Initialize (Beta) =

"""Processes input terrain types and creates biome regions, assigning necessary biome attributes and data used by the suite of biome tools."""


For terrain, Biome Initialize converts input terrain types into a Houdini Heightfield volume. For biome regions, the different options create flat, single-poly regions with primitive attributes and biome settings to deliminate the bounds of the expected biomes. Multiple input types are supported , but the two output types will always be a Houdini Heightfield volume for terrain and polygonal regions for biomes.

:note:
	The biome tools are in beta and are subject to change based off of feedback, testing, and future development. We encourage our users to let us know of any feedback or bugs they encounter while using these tools.
